- `GET /api/images/:id`
- `POST /api/images/:id/comments` - consumer only
- `POST /api/images/:id/rate` - consumer only

### Search

- `GET /api/search?q=mountain`

## Sample Requests

### Signup

```http
POST /api/auth/signup
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "ali.photography",
  "email": "ali@example.com",
  "password": "secret123",
  "role": "creator"
}
```

### Login

```http
POST /api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

  "email": "ali@example.com",
  "password": "secret123"
}
```

### Upload Image

Send `multipart/form-data` with:

- `image` - file
- `title` - string
- `caption` - string
- `location` - string
- `people` - comma-separated names or repeated fields

Include:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## Docker

### Docker Compose (Local Development)

Start all services with Redis caching:

```bash
# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

### Docker (Production)

Build and run with:

```bash
docker build -t photo-sharing-api .
docker run --env-file .env -p 5001:5001 photo-sharing-api
```

## Notes

- This API is stateless and ready to sit behind a frontend or API gateway.
- Redis caching improves performance for image lists and search results.
- Docker Compose provides complete development environment with MongoDB and Redis.
- Uploaded images are resized and compressed before being sent to Cloudinary.
- Automated deployment to EC2 via GitHub Actions on main branch pushes.
